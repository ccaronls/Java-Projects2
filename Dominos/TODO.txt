- MP When round changes on client, it crashes (fixed. This caused by deserialization of root Tile form
non-null to null. Need more thorough unit tests for Reflector to make sure we can convert from non-null to null all object types.)
- confirm MP with release (done)
- confirm MP with > 2 players (done)
- confirm MP with a new game (done)
- consider menu flow for UI in MP vs. SP
- support MP for PC app
- allow MP between PC and android
- behavior of disconnect from server end needs work (ok?)
- MP Host mode should save state onPause (done)
- For listeners, copy into temp collection for iteration, catch errors and remove from
  persistent collection. This allows listeners to remove themselves form the callbacks otherwise
  we get concurrent modification type exceptions. (done)
  - Add skip button when shuffle anim is going
- Display POOL = (Boneyard?) in a better spot (bottom LHS of info?)
- Animate from pool more quickly and also animate players getting theor pieces on start of round
- Use more varied pieces for intro anim

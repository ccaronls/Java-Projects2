E-Signing is a valid legal document according to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&amp;url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-106s761enr/pdf/BILLS-106s761enr.pdf">Federal ESIGN Act of 2000</a>.  In short, electronic documentation
is as good as old fashoned paper. The system we employ is fashoined like those you use at the grocery store or when accepting deliveries.
We take your signature for the purpose of constructing a image of the form and then emmediatly discard it.  The form as an image cannot be 
modified and it is easily printed out for your records.

<h4><u>Miscellaneous.</u></h4>
This EULA, including the CECC Solutions privacy policy which is incorporated by reference, is the entire agreement between you and CECC Solutions with respect to, and supersedes
any previous oral or written communications or documents (including, if you are obtaining an update, any agreement that may have been included with an earlier version of any part 
of the System) concerning, the subject matter of this EULA. In no event shall any additional or inconsistent term in any purchase order or similar document submitted by you modify
the terms of this EULA.
 
This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, as such laws apply to contracts between California residents entered into and performed entirely in California 
(notwithstanding your place of residency), except that the dispute resolution clause below shall be enforced and interpreted exclusively in accordance with applicable U.S. federal 
law, including the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. This EULA will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If any provision of this 
EULA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of this EULA will remain in full force and effect. Failure by CECC Solutions 
to prosecute any right with respect to a default hereunder will not constitute a waiver by CECC Solutions of the right to enforce rights with respect to the same or any other breach.
Dispute Resolution.  BY AGREEING TO THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND CECC SOLUTIONS BY INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION, AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.  
PLEASE READ THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW ANY CLAIMS YOU AND CECC SOLUTIONS HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.  
You and CECC Solutions agree to binding arbitration to resolve all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this agreement or to your use of the System.  If you are a resident 
of country other than the United States, then CECC Solutions and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the U.S. federal court in San Francisco, California in order to 
compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, and/or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  By agreeing to binding 
arbitration, you and CECC Solutions are giving up the right to litigate a dispute in court before a judge or jury, and the ability to appeal an arbitrator's award will be limited to 
the rights available under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. In an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator will be empowered to award, on an individual basis, damages or other relief,
 subject to the rules of arbitration described below.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may choose to litigate a dispute in small claims court if small claims court is available in 
 your jurisdiction and if your claims qualify, and either Party shall be entitled to seek preliminary injunctive relief or other temporary relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time.
The arbitration shall be binding and be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single neutral arbitrator.  Questions of arbitrability (i.e., whether a claim 
should be decided by the arbitrator or by a court) shall be for the arbitrator to decide.  The arbitration shall be conducted in English, unless both parties mutually agree that it may be conducted in another language.
The arbitration shall be conducted under the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless the parties agree that the Consumer Arbitration Rules should nevertheless apply.  
For more information about these rules or about the AAA, visit www.adr.org, or call 1-800-778-7879. 
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submission, or in person in San Francisco, CA or at another mutually agreed location.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except that for claims totaling less than $10,000, CECC Solutions will pay all applicable arbitrator's
 fees and will not seek reimbursement from you unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written 
 settlement offer made before an arbitrator was designated (or if we did not make you a settlement offer before the arbitrator was designated), then CECC Solutions will pay you the amount of the award 
 or $1,000, whichever is greater, and reimburse any expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) that you reasonably accrue for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
You and CECC Solutions agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis, and that neither party may bring claims against the other as a plaintiff or class 
member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including any private attorney general action or consolidated proceeding.  No arbitration or proceeding can be combined, consolidated, 
or joined with another arbitration or proceeding without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding.  The arbitrator may award relief in favor of or against only the individual 
party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s).  If this class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or 
some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. 
 
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and CECC Solutions each waive any right to a jury trial.
 
If any portion of this 'Dispute Resolution' section is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, that portion shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
 
YOU MUST FILE A COMPLAINT WITH AAA OR A PERMITTED COURT WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED ON SUCH EVENT OR FACTS.

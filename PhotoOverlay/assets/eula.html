    extent permitted by the terms and conditions of the software marketplace (including the Apple App Store [for devices using iOS] and Google Play [for
    devices using Android]) through which the Software was offered to you (the "App Store/Play Terms"), and (c) use the Services as they may be provided to
    you; in each case, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. In the event of any conflict between this EULA and the App Store/Play Terms, this EULA
    shall control. You acknowledge that CECC Solutions has no control over the App Store/Play Terms and further that CECC Solutions bears no responsibility or

<p>

</p>
<p>
    At its sole discretion, CECC Solutions may from time to time offer updates to the Software and/or Services ("Update(s)"). These Updates may expand,
    diminish, or change the features or functionality of the System. CECC Solutions grants you a limited non-exclusive license to download Updates in order to

    you choose not to install an Update, the functionality of the Software and Services could be affected and/or compromised. CECC Solutions will not be held
    liable for any change in functionality of the System resulting from your decision not to install a provided Update.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. Device Limitations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your use of the System is limited to compatible devices only and may require the use of data made available to you by your mobile telecom service provider
    as detailed below:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C-1. System Requirements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use of the System requires a compatible Apple iOS or Google Android mobile device, such as a tablet (e.g., Apple iPad, Google Nexus, etc.) or smartphone
    (e.g., Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), and said device must be equipped with a camera and be capable of sending email. You acknowledge and agree that
    meeting all such mobile device system requirements is within your own responsibility and that CECC Solutions will bear no responsibility for your attempted
    use of the System on any incompatible device, including but not limited to any resulting damage to your Device.

</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Use of the System involves transmission of data to and from your mobile device, and such transmission may cause you to incur charges under your mobile
    telecom service provider's data plan. You acknowledge and agree that all such charges are within your own responsibility. CECC Solutions bears no
    responsibility for the data transmission process between you and your provider. The data transmission process (including its speed, connectivity, and/or
    quality) is administered by and lies within the responsibility of your mobile telecom service provider; therefore, CECC Solutions is not responsible for
    nor can CECC Solutions be held liable for any degradation of functionality that may result therefrom during your use of the System.

    any such information on your device, nor will CECC Solutions bear any liability for any loss of stored information due to a lost or malfunctioning device,
    Software error, Systems failure, theft, third-party act or omission, act of God, failure to maintain a reliable backup, or for any other cause. By using
    the System, you agree that the responsibility to keep safe any such information and/or back up any such information in case of loss is yours and yours
    alone.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>H. Disclaimer of All Warranties.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    H-1. You may or may not have a third-party warranty that covers your Device. Any such warranty applies only to the Device, not the System, and was not
    provided by, agreed to, ratified, or consented to by CECC Solutions. CECC Solutions has no obligation under any such warranty.
</p>
<p>
    H-2. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
    THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, EFFORT, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS BORNE BY YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, NONE OF CECC
    SOLUTIONS, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, OR ANY PROVIDER OF ANY MARKETPLACE FOR DOWNLOADING APPS THROUGH WHICH THE SYSTEM WAS OFFERED TO YOU,
    OR ANY OF CECC SOLUTIONS' OR ITS AFFILIATES' RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, REPRESENTATIVES, OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "CECC
    SOLUTIONS PARTIES"), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR THE SERVICING AND/OR REPAIR OF YOUR DEVICE OR ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM.
</p>
<p>
    H-3. THE CECC SOLUTIONS PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT. THE CECC

    SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR DEVICES, OR THAT THE
    SYSTEM WILL BE FREE FROM LOSS, CORRUPTION, ATTACK, OR VIRUSES, OR THAT ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES OR NONCONFORMITY TO ITS OR THEIR DOCUMENTATION
    CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. YOU FURTHER ACKNOLWEDGE THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE IN SITUATIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THE FAILURE OR
    TIME DELAYS OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN THE CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR
    ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL,
    LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
</p>
<p>
    H-4. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION (SECTION "H") ARE A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT AND CONSIDERATION TO CECC SOLUTIONS TO GRANT THE LICENSE
    CONTAINED IN THIS EULA AND TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN PROMISE, ADVICE, OR INFORMATION PROVIDED TO YOU BY
    ANY SELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF DEVICES, ANY CECC SOLUTIONS LICENSEE, OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF CECC SOLUTIONS WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OBLIGATION OF CECC
    SOLUTIONS. THE CECC SOLUTIONS PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL EQUITABLE INDEMNITIES.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. Exclusion and Limitation of Damages and Liability.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CECC SOLUTIONS PARTY OR ANY CECC SOLUTIONS LICENSEE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTIONS, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, DAMAGE TO ANY COMPUTER OR DEVICE, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THIS EULA, YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO
    USE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY DATA YOU MAY ACCESS IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, OR ANY ACTIVITIES
    WITH WHICH YOU USE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF SUCH CECC SOLUTIONS PARTY OR LICENSEE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SHOULD ANY
    CECC SOLUTIONS PARTIES BE FOUND TO BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, SUCH LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S.
    DOLLARS ($100.00) IN THE AGGREGATE IN ANY EVENT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>J. Exclusions and Effects of Local Laws.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.
    Furthermore, mandatory local consumer protection laws, which this EULA does not replace or exclude, may offer you legal rights and remedies in addition to
    the rights and remedies provided to you under this EULA. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent
    that CECC Solutions may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty
    and the extent of CECC Solutions' liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law. You further agree that this limitation represents a
    material inducement and consideration for CECC Solutions to grant the license afforded to you under the terms of this EULA.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>K. Conditions and Effect of Termination.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This EULA is effective until it is terminated. You may terminate this EULA at any time without notice to CECC Solutions by destroying all copies of the
    Software and related documentation in your possession or under your control and ceasing all use of the System (such as by completely deleting the Software
    and all related documentation from your device). This EULA will automatically terminate if you violate any of the terms of this EULA. Upon termination of
    this EULA for any reason, all license rights granted to you shall immediately terminate. However, all other provisions of this EULA shall survive and apply
    in full force after such termination.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>L. Use Outside the United States Is Not Supported.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The System is not available for use in all countries or regions, nor is it translated into all languages your Device may support. CECC Solutions makes no
    representation that the System, or any part of it, is available, legal, or appropriate for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use
    or access the System outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for compliance with all applicable Laws, including
    without limitation all privacy laws and any laws that may entirely forbid use of the System.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>M. Special Disclosure to End Users of the United States Government.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The System and related documentation are "Commercial Items," as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Part 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software"
    and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Part 12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Part 227.7202, as applicable. Consistent
    with 48 C.F.R. Part 12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Part 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the System and related documentation are being licensed to U.S.
    Government end users (a) only as "Commercial Items," and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and
    conditions herein.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N. Miscellaneous Provisions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-1. Merger.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This EULA, including the CECC Solutions Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference, is the entire agreement between you and CECC Solutions with
    respect to your use of the System, and this EULA supersedes any previous oral or written communications or documents (including, if you are obtaining an
    Update, any agreement that may have been included with an earlier version of any part of the System) concerning the subject matter of this EULA. Any data
transmitted to CECC Solutions from your Device in connection with your use of the System will be handled according to the CECC Solutions Privacy Policy.    <strong>(**Delete Before Adopting**</strong> The EULA references the Privacy Policy, but as of yet there is no indication where it can be found. I
    recommend stating here in this section where the user can read the Privacy Policy if he or she wishes to do so. This link does not exist yet, of course,
    but just as an example, something like <a href="http://www.ceccsolutions.com/privacy">http://www.ceccsolutions.com/privacy</a> would be one way to cover
    your bases. <strong>**Delete Before Adopting**)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-2. No End-User Modification.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In no event shall any additional or inconsistent term in any purchase order or similar document submitted by you, or any oral discussion between you and
    any agent or purported agent of CECC Solutions, modify the terms of this EULA, which shall be deemed controlling in all respects at all relevant times.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-3. Choice of Law.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America, as such laws apply to contracts between California residents
    entered into and performed entirely in California (notwithstanding your place of residency), except that the dispute resolution clause below (Part "O")
    shall be enforced and interpreted exclusively in accordance with applicable U.S. federal law, including the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-4. Non-Applicability of United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This EULA will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-5. Severability. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If any provision of this EULA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law and the
    remainder of this EULA shall remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>N-6. Durable Reservation of CECC Solutions' Rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Failure by CECC Solutions to prosecute any right with respect to a default hereunder will not constitute a waiver by CECC Solutions of the right to enforce
    its rights with respect to the same or any other breach, whether past, present, or future, nor will CECC Solutions' election to waive any one provision at
    any point in time constitute a future, ongoing, or broad waiver of the waived provision or any other provision. CECC Solutions expressly reserves all of
    its rights under this EULA at all times.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O. Mandatory Arbitration for All Dispute Resolution.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    BY AGREEING TO THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND CECC SOLUTIONS BY SUBMITTING TO INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION AS DESCRIBED IN
    THIS SECTION. PLEASE READ THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW ANY CLAIMS YOU AND CECC SOLUTIONS HAVE
    AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-1. Binding Arbitration.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You and CECC Solutions agree to binding arbitration to resolve all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this agreement or to your use of
        the System.
    </strong>
    If you are a resident of a country or some jurisdiction other than the United States, then both you and CECC Solutions mutually agree to submit to the
    personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose Division), sitting in San Jose, California, in order
    to seek a court order compelling arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, and/or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award
    entered by the arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-2. Effect of Arbitration; Mutual Waiver of Rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    By agreeing to binding arbitration, you and CECC Solutions are knowingly giving up the right to litigate a dispute in court before a judge or jury, and the
    ability to appeal an arbitrator's award will be limited to the rights available under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and/or the California Arbitration
    Act, as applicable. In an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator will be empowered to award, on an individual basis, damages or other relief, subject to the
    rules of arbitration described below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-3. Small Claims Court Alternative; Qualifying Events.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may choose to litigate a dispute in small claims court upon timely notice to CECC Solutions if small claims court is
    available in your jurisdiction and if your claims qualify, and either Party shall be entitled to seek preliminary injunctive relief or other temporary
    relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-4. Choice of Administrator; Appointment of Arbitrator; Procedures.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration shall be binding on both parties and be conducted under the administration of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") before a single
    neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be appointed from the AAA's National Roster of Arbitrators according to the applicable rules and procedures of
    AAA. Questions of arbitrability (i.e., whether a claim should be decided by the arbitrator or by a court) shall be for the arbitrator to decide. The
    arbitration shall be conducted in English, unless both parties mutually agree that it may be conducted in another language. The arbitration shall be
    conducted under the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, unless the parties agree that the Commercial Arbitration Rules should not apply. For more
    information about these rules or about the AAA, visit www.adr.org, or call 1-800-778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitrator decide on written
    submissions only (known to AAA as a "desk arbitration") or after the presentation of evidence at a hearing, which can be conducted either by telephone or
    held in person in San Jose, California, or at another mutually agreed-upon location.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-5. Fees; Claims Less Than $10,000; Effect of Settlement Offers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except that for claims totaling less than $5,000, CECC
    Solutions will pay all applicable arbitrator's fees and will not seek reimbursement from you unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous
    and/or constitute harassment. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an
    arbitrator was designated (or if we did not make you a settlement offer before the arbitrator was designated), then CECC Solutions will pay you the amount
    of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-6. Individual Disputes Only; Prohibition Against Class Actions, Etc.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You and CECC Solutions agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis, and that neither party may bring claims
    against the other as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including any private attorney general
    action, multi-district litigation, or consolidated proceeding. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined, consolidated, or joined with another
    arbitration or proceeding without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief in favor of or
    against only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). If
    this class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court
    of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-7. Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and CECC Solutions each waive any right to a jury trial.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-8. Severability of Arbitration Provisions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If any portion or sub-portion of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, that invalid portion shall
    be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>O-9. One-Year Claim Period.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    YOU MUST FILE A COMPLAINT WITH AAA OR A PERMITTED COURT WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM, OR YOU
    WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED ON SUCH EVENT OR FACTS.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>P. End-User Terms Required by App Stores and Marketplaces.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding anything in this EULA to the contrary, you have no greater rights to use the System than are permitted under the Usage Rules in the App

    will have any other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the System, and, as between CECC Solutions and Apple or Google, any other claims,

    to the terms of this EULA; (vi) CECC Solutions, not Apple or Google, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the
    System or your possession and/or use of the System, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the System fails to
    conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; (vii) In the event of

E-Signing is a valid legal document according to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&amp;url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-106s761enr/pdf/BILLS-106s761enr.pdf">Federal ESIGN Act of 2000</a>.
In short, electronic documentation is as good as old fashioned paper. The system we provide is similar to those you use at the grocery store or when accepting deliveries.
Electronic forms have a number of advantages in addition to simplifying processes:
- The final document is more secure than paper because it will persist on multiple servers.
- Forgeries are easy to detect.
- You can alway choose to print out the emailed form for your records at a later time.

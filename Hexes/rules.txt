Rules of the Game:

Hexes is a 2 player board game whereby each player places triangular pieces on the
board to make points


Each player places triangular shaped pieces on the bord to gain points. Each piece has a
shape on the piece.

SHAPE       PTS         MULTIPLIER          HOW TO FORM
---------+---------+------------------+----------------------------------------
DIAMOND  |   1     |       1          |  Any to triangular pieces of same color
TRIANGLE |   2     |       2          |  4 triangles of same color to form a larger triangle
HEXAGON  |   3     |       3          |  6 triangular pieces of same color forming a hexagon

The game is over when a player has played 6 of each type of piece.

No 2 pieces of the same type can be adjacent.

Players form shapes from the triangles to gain points.

Here are the ways to form the different shapes:

 ____
 \  / \   A Diamond formed by 2 triangles
  \/___\


       /\
      /__\      A Triangle formed by 4 smaller triangles
     /\  /\
    /__\/__\

       ____
      /\  /\
     /__\/__\   A Hexagon formed by six triangles
     \  /\  /
      \/__\/

Points are computed as follows:

Each piece gives points determined by the points from with multiplier of the
overall group shape that piece is apart of.

For instance, if you form a diamond from a triangle and a hexagon, the points earned are:

Pts = D * D + D * H
    = 1 * 1 + 1 * 3
    = 4

If you form a triangle from 2 triangles, 1 hex and 1 diamond then


Pts = T * T + T * T + H * T + D * T
    = 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 1 * 2
    =     4 +     4 +     6 +     2
    = 16

- Allow a player to leave and another to join (test)
- Fix array index out of bounds exception (done?)
- no infinite wait for remote exec calls (done?)
  - Better way: put waiting for input from player in separate thread so we dont block the in/out cmd queues.
- allow for spectators that can become players on a new game to replace player with fewest pts
- Allow server to kick out players (done)
- Figure out extern strings for localization
- Track max string width and use that to determine height of text (or wrap the text?)
  - Maybe fixed text size is better then just wrap player names? <--- Fixed text width more predictable
- Notify users when players or server pauses or resumes their game
- Allow users to set their name (alias or handle or icon? or pic?)
   - use camera to face capture and use thumb as icon!
- Player layout is terrible. Should be a player on each side or something.
  - Diamond shaped board with player in each corner?
- Add sound effects.
- Need animation of player making a more, reuse the same from tile from pool anim.
- Remember game params in settings
- Fix inconsistent corners on tiles (some are round and some are more square)
- Dont ever allow text overlapp
- When a client moves, there is ui glitch that can be avoided if client simply updates game state itself
  and includes a flag to server to omit broadcasting back to the client.
- test in release mode (90% sure this is ok. Need final test)
- Add about screen and splash screen
- Try diamond shared board with player in each corner?
- Speed up the end of round points anim.
- Dont shuffle when a player has won the game. Allow players to skip shuffle anim when they press menu (SKIP?)
- Fix 'Failed Busy' Toast - Busy seems to be benign, but ERROR could mean WiFi is off

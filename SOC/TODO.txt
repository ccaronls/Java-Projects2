Apply these rules:
- A player can only play a development card once per turn. 
  (DONE, untested) 

- Victory cards are not played until the player has the winning points (so this means that victory cards can be stolen until the end of the game)
  This should probably be an automatic thing. 
  (DONE, untested)  

- Rules should have min/max players

Seafarers expansion
- AI Needs to quantify the ships route
- Add undiscovered tiles
  (DONE) 
- Prevent building initial settlements on islands 
  (DONE, configurable) 
- compute longest route for player needs to only consider roads that connect to ships at a structure
- AI Should consider proximity to islands and undiscovered territory
  (DONE, use of Floyd-Marshall algorithm produces nice results)  
- Looks like computeMaxRouteLengthForPlayer has a bug
  (FIXED, needed to track visited edges, not vertices)
- When adding edges for the Walsh-Marshall argorithm, should consider edges owned by user as weight=0, this will simplify the min distance computation, 
  we basically only consider structures.  Also, structures on a coast line should be treated differently, or at least accounted for.  Roads vs Ships 
  on a coastline are a problem.
- Pirate should be able to move along a track on each turn instead of being moved by player.
  
Core Game Improvements  
- Should be able to define a 'game' as a board and a rule set to customize the experience.  Should be able to define the expansions as described in the seafarers pdf
- Reflector should have a header and version.  Also fix indentation in reflector.
- Optimization of compuetMoveOptions should return a List<Move> where Move is struct { MoveType move; List options; }
- UNDO should be serializable 
  (Workaround: don't save game when we 'canCancel') 
- Robber/Pirate options should only include those cells with players adjacent 
  (DONE, untested) 
- SOC should have only pushFront, no pushBack, to reduce confusion
  (DONE needs more testing)
- Remove rollDice from Player and make roll dice a move type. (this is needed to CAK expansion where user can perform a roll_dice OR play a certain progress card)
  (DONE tested)
- Remove the individual development card types?  Just MoveType.PLAY_DEVELOPMENT with a list of ordinals? 
- No need for INIT_GAME state, this is implied when no states.
  (DONE tested)
- AINode can be extend Refector so we can save and restore the trees for analysis from a AI debug UI.
- Board should be able to expensive operations.  Vertex, Route and Tile to have a ptr to Board so they can invalidate 
  caches during changes.
- AIEvaluator should have a set of string->double pairs where the double is a scaling factor on a particular evaluation that can be tuned from a GUI 


Add knights and cites expansion option

CAK Rule Details:
- Players start with 1 settlement and 1 city and 2 raods
  (DONE, untested)
- Robber/Pirate not movable until the barbarians attack for first time.  
  Still rolling a 7 results in the giveup cards procedure.
- Can only promote to mightly knight once the 3rd level blue (politics) achieved
  (Done, not tested)
- Losing your last city to barbarians means you keep your progress cards and improvements
  (Done?  Nothing to do)
- When barbarians attack:
  - Strength of barbarians = sum count of all cities and metropoli on the board
  - Strength of catan      = sum of all ACTIVE knights strengths (1, 2, or 3)
  (DONE, untested)
- If barbarians are stronger, then
  - player with lowest strength active knights have 1 city reduced to settlement (not counting players with no cities or only metropolis)
  - players of equal weakness all lose a city
  - If a player who has a city attacked has a wall, then the wall is removed and the city remains
  (DONE, untested)
- If catan is greater or equal to barbarians then
  - When a single player has highest value active knights then they get the 'Defender of Catan' Victory point placed face up (not takeable)
  - If players tie, then no victory points awarded, instead each eligible player gets to draw 1 card from any of the Progress card stacks   
- After attack, barbarians return to starting position and all knights become inactive
- A player obtains a progress card when the event die shows , Science(green), Politics(blue) or Trade(yellow) and the red die 
  is 1 of the die showing for that players improvement.  For instance, if a player has a first level improvement in trade, and a trade
  event is rolled, then that player can only draw a progress card if a 1 shows on the red die.  A second level improvement deals a progress card
  if a 1 or 2 is showing and so on.  A 6 on the red die never produces a progress card since there are only 5 levels of improvement.  
- Max 4 progress cards in hand at any one time
- CAK uses 3 dice, 1, red, 1 yellow and 1 event.  The red is used to determine Progress card distribution.
(DONE, partially tested)

Add barbarians and traders expansion option

Make rules not need annotations which dont work well with localiztion!!!

Apply these rules:

- A player can only play a development card once per turn. 
  (DONE, untested) 

Seafarers expansion

Core Game Improvements  
- AINode can be extend Refector so we can save and restore the trees for analysis from a AI debug UI.

CAK Rule Details:
- Robber/Pirate not movable until the barbarians attack for first time.
  Still rolling a 7 results in the give up cards procedure. (DONE needs testing)
- Losing your last city to barbarians means you keep your progress cards and improvements
  (Done?  Nothing to do)
(DONE, partially tested)

- BUG: I noticed that I was able to build a opening settlement on a undiscovered tile when the opponents road was there. investigate.

- IMPROVEMENT: Show indication bot is thinking
- BUG: GUI Assertion when picking a botnode during AI tuning.
- IMPROVEMENT: GUI Ai Tuning - Don't dump info to console instead display omn screen with dimmed bk

- Make sure AI considers attacking options

- Put the name of the board on top on Android

- Clean up how cards are rendered. There should not be vertical overlap if possible.
  Also counting the card occurrences is not working. Need to keep a stack I guess

- Barbarian attack popup does not show summary. Also no cancel button on popup.
- Rules dialog should not be cancelable on touch outside.
- Help text causes left panel to shift around
- Tiles need to be more obvious what they produce
- Should have a intro screen to show the basics
- Help text on Right hand side?
- Console scrolling should work better
- AI Randomness need to be more thought out. Having a scale factor is too large an impact on the overall score. Basically
  the AI is never attacking.
  I think move options that have randomness (like attacks) should be considered when the the AI rolls the dice.
  For instance, if attacking a road has a 2 in 6 chance of succeeding, then only add the move to the total move set
  if the AI randomly chooses a value between 0-2 out of 6.
- There should be different AI tuning for each scenario and also different tuning to support different strategies.
- Warships count toward Army? (DONE, I think its a good balancing feature. Makes warships more valuable.)
- Should not have popups for attacks, instead a longer animation with some pomp and circumstance)
- PlayerBot: 1. Each bot should have own tuning. Can get different behaviors with different tunings.
             2. Need to have tuning vars for attacks.
             3. Should be able to have bot target a buildable.
                - If we have good candidates for settlement, then should strive to collect resources to that end.
                - If we have lots of settlements and few cities, should target resources for that end
                - If we have lots of unprotected tiles then we should strive to build knights
                - If we have the robber next to us, then strive for resources to draw a development
             4. Add distance eval for attackable roads, structures etc.
